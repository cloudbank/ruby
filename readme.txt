game.rb:
	 This is funny game from "Learning Ruby The Hard Way" that I put into
	 separate files as an exercise in dynamic methods and ruby OO. I plan
	 to turn it into a different game eventually.

	several useful methods besides floor division
	
test_integer_division.rb
	lots of tests for all the methods
